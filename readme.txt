NOTE:
The R script (Wage_Tracking.r) in this folder will calculate wage allocations by project and project investigator (PI)
based on dates entered in input_files/reporting_period. Script is designed to work on period of
about one month. This script was written at the beginning of 2021 and used on wage data self-
reported by field staff from January 3, 2021 onward. Self-reported wage data is recorded on
spreadhseets. For wage tracking data prior to 2021 (i.e., 2018-2020) there are scripts
unique to each year located in respective folders (labeled by year) in the archives folder.
Scripts are unique to each year because reporting was inconsistent by year and among employees. This
is because the program for tracking wages was in a test phase. Additionally, employees mostly 
tracked hours in Google Calendar from 2018 to 2020. Data was converted from Google Calendar format
to .csv files with the GTimeReport website.
